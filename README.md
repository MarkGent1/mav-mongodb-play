# MAV MongoDb Playground

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose of this repository

The intention for this repository is to act as a personal 'Playground' to demonstrate how to use the MongoDb Client with DDD patterns.

Health checks have been added for:
 - MongoDb

**Note**. Please run the API using the Docker Compose configuration which is set up to run using `localstack` in the container to test AWS connectivity. A MongoDb instance should also be available (in this example it is set up assuming an instance running on the local development machine).
